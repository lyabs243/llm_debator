# LLM Debator 
This is a project using different LLMs abilities to debate against each other.

User will provide a topic, select two LLMs from the available options, give a role to each LLM (e.g., Proponent, Opponent), the tone of each LLM among the available options like Formal, Informal, Humorous, Serious, Sarcastic, Enthusiastic, Neutral, and the number of rounds for the debate.

It is possible to continue the debate for more rounds after the initial rounds are completed, to reset and start a new debate.
